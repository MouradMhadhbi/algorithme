# Sentence Analysis Project

## Description

    This project reads a sentence ending with a period (`.`) and analyzes it by determining:

        - The total number of characters (including the period)
        - The number of words (assuming words are separated by a single space)
        - The number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u, both uppercase and lowercase)

    The program reads the sentence **character by character** and manually counts all elements **without using predefined functions** like `length()`.

---

## Features

    - Counts characters including the period.
    - Counts words based on spaces.
    - Counts vowels manually.
    - Works for both uppercase and lowercase vowels.
    - Reads input as a full sentence.

## Example

**Input:**  
    Hello world.
**Output:**  
    Sentence length = 12
    Number of words = 2
    Number of vowels = 3

**Explanation:**  
    - `Sentence length = 12` → counts all characters including the period  
    - `Number of words = 2` → "Hello" and "world"  
    - `Number of vowels = 3` → e, o, o
